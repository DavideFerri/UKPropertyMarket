Some notes on the repository:

  - filter.py filters the data to get only post-2013 records.
  - process.py processes the data to get .csv files for class execution (to be replaced with databases)
  - classes.py defines the main classes
  - main.py creates a simple user application
  
  Jupyter notebooks are also included.
